## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### What I learned

I used Tailwind CSS for styling this project. Some of the benefits I found from using Tailwind:

- Rapid development with utility classes instead of writing custom CSS
- Consistent, designed system using Tailwind's design constraints
- Easy to make site responsive with mobile-first approach
- Reusable classes that work across projects
- Minimal custom CSS needed

### Continued development

Areas I want to continue focusing on:

- Responsive design
- Accessibility
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
